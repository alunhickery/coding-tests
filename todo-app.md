# To do app

This coding test is to build a small web app to capture a to-do list. The 
features that form the to-do app are described as [user stories]. There are 
some [technical requirements] that we require you adhere to. Finally we have 
some [expectations] that describes what we expect from you.


## User Stories

*As a* forgetful person  
*I need* to record things I need to do  
*so that* I will never forget them

*As a* proactive person  
*I need* to see the to dos I haven't yet done  
*so that* I can pick the next one to do

*As a* successful to do doer  
*I need* to mark a to do as complete  
*so that* I don't see it on my list of unfinished to dos

*As a* person with demands on my time  
*I need* to prioritise my to dos  
*so that* I don't forget which are most important to do


## Technical Requirements

- Languages that are allowed are Node.JS and Java
- You can use either language for either component
- You can use any libraries or frameworks
- Use as little client side Javascript as you can


## Expectations

All of these expectations are up to your own judgement. If you think you should
you can deviate from these expectations. Expect us to we challenge you on why 
you have made that change.

**We expect:**
- A Restful API
- A simple web frontend
- A Readme that describes what you've built and how to run it

**We don't expect:**
- The app deployed anywhere
- A complex, detailed frontend design. Simple bootstrap or plain HTML is fine.
- Data to be persisted in a database.
- Exhaustive documentation

We have expectations that we have not documented here.
